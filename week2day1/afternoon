1️ ROLLBACK Without SAVEPOINT: Will Earlier Updates Persist?
No. If you execute multiple updates within a transaction and an error occurs (e.g., in the third statement), issuing a `ROLLBACK` without a `SAVEPOINT` will undo **all** changes made in the transaction, including the first two updates. PostgreSQL does not automatically create savepoints for each statement, so without explicitly setting one, the entire transaction is rolled back. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

2️ READ COMMITTED Isolation: Can Transaction B See Uncommitted Changes from Transaction A?
No. Under the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level (PostgreSQL's default), a transaction only sees data that was committed before the query began. It does not see uncommitted changes from other transactions. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

3️ Concurrent Updates to the Same Row: Will One Overwrite the Other?
No, one will not overwrite the other. When two concurrent transactions attempt to update the same row, PostgreSQL uses row-level locking to manage concurrency:
- The first transaction to acquire the lock proceeds with the update.
- The second transaction waits until the first transaction completes (either commits or rolls back).
This mechanism ensures data integrity and prevents lost updates. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}

4️ ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT: What Gets Undone?
Executing `ROLLBACK TO SAVEPOINT after_alice;` undoes all commands executed after the specified savepoint (`after_alice`) within the current transaction. Changes made before the savepoint remain intact. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

5️ Which Isolation Level Prevents Phantom Reads in PostgreSQL?
The `REPEATABLE READ` isolation level prevents phantom reads. At this level, a transaction sees a consistent snapshot of the database throughout its execution, ensuring that repeated queries return the same results, even if other transactions insert new rows. :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

6️ Can PostgreSQL Perform a Dirty Read?
No. PostgreSQL does not allow dirty reads. Even if a transaction is set to `READ UNCOMMITTED`, PostgreSQL treats it as `READ COMMITTED`, preventing transactions from reading uncommitted changes made by other transactions. :contentReference[oaicite:5]{index=5}

7️ Autocommit ON: Are Changes Immediately Committed After an UPDATE?
Yes. With autocommit enabled (the default in PostgreSQL), each individual statement is executed in its own transaction and is automatically committed upon successful completion. :contentReference[oaicite:6]{index=6}

8️ Uncommitted UPDATE Visibility in Another Session: Will It See the Change?
No. If you perform an `UPDATE` within a transaction and do not commit it, other sessions will not see the change. Under the `READ COMMITTED` isolation level, a session only sees data that was committed before its query began. :contentReference[oaicite:7]{index=7}
